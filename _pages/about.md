I am a second-year MSCS student at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University.

My research interests include Large Language Models (LLMs), model compression, machine learning, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Currently, I am focused on applying model compression techniques to LLMs.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yingyan Lin at Georgia Tech. During my time at Tsinghua University, I was advised by Prof. Gang Liu.
