I'm a second year MSCS student from [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Before that I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in [Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)

My research interest includes LLMs, Model Compression, Machine Learning and SLAM. Currently, I'm focusing on deploying model compression techniques on LLMs.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yingyan Lin at Georgia Tech. I was advised by Prof. Gang Liu from Tsinghua University.
